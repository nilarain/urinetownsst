        <h1>About SST</h1>

        <h3>
            The Schaumburg Summer Theatre, sponsored by the Village of Schaumburg, presents
            full-scale musicals featuring the talents of high school and college students from
            the northwest suburbs.
        </h3>
        <br>
        <p>

            The Summer Theatre's first production of Bye Bye Birdie in 1989 featured 35 actors,
            singers, and dancers, and played for three performances over one weekend. Since then,
            the number of performances has increased to four over two weekends, with casts that
            have boasted as many as 70 students. Past productions have included <i>Anything Goes</i>,
            <i>The Cocoanuts</i>, <i>Can Can</i>, <i>Guys and Dolls</i>, <i>Damn Yankees</i>, <i>My One and Only</i>,
            <i>Brigadoon</i>, <i>Little Johnny Jones</i>,<i>Once Upon a Mattress</i>, <i>Oliver</i>,
            <i>The Pirates of Penzance</i>, <i>How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying</i>, <i>Kiss Me Kate</i>,
            <i>A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum</i>, <i>West Side Story</i>, <i>Sweeney Todd</i>, and <i>Ragtime</i>.
            <br><br>
            The program has garnered tremendous box office success, often playing to sold out
            houses. The shows have also become critical hits, earning several Pioneer Press
            Boonie Awards in recognition for outstanding community theatre in the northwest
            suburbs.  Many Summer Theatre alumni have gone on to professional careers, including
            Broadway, network television, film, opera and dance. The program can also boast a
            Tony Award winner among its alumni.
            <br><br>
            Actors, singers, and dancers are cast by audition, held around Memorial Day weekend.
            Rehearsals and performances are held at the Schaumburg Prairie Center for the Arts.
