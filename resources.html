                    <h3>The Genesis of Urinetown</h3>
                    <p>
                        Urinetown was created by Mark Hollmann and Greg Kotis, who both attended the University of Chicago and have worked extensively in the fields of music, acting, and playwriting.
                        <br><br>
                        Greg Kotis cites his poorly planned trip to Europe in 1995 as the inspiration for Urinetown. In his foreword, he writes that he believed three hundred dollars would be enough to cover expenses for two weeks in Europe. He quickly realized that it would not be enough, and the trip devolved into a “grim test of endurance” which included, strangely, avoiding using the bathroom as much as possible. Public bathrooms are pay-per-use in Europe, so one day, while weighing how badly he needed to use the restroom, Kotis was struck with the idea for the show.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>
                            “I stood there on the sidewalk for a moment or two, thinking the thing through. The notion seemed like a patently awful one, grand and ridiculous, a career (such as it was) ending embarrassment. And yet, at its core, it would also be a grand, ridiculous reflection of the world as we know it to be, complete with rich and poor, the powerful and the powerless, a government controlled by industry and an industry that exists apart from and above us all. And driving it all would be the disaster, in this case the drought, a fact that trumped all the other facts: the love, the rage, the greed, everything. It would be a musical, yes, a very big musical, and it would be called Urinetown, The Musical.”
                        </p>
                        <small>Greg Kotis <cite title="Source Title">Urinetown The Musical Foreword</cite></small>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>
                        And it would be big. Huge, in fact. Once he returned from Europe, Kotis began working on this project immediately. He knew that Mark Hollmann, who was apart of an improv theatre troupe with Kotis when he was in college, would be the perfect partner to tackle the score. By 1997, a first draft of the script was written, and the two worked every Sunday afternoon at the church where Hollmann was an organist to craft the final product. The show was finally finished in 1998, and they began sending inquiries to agents, but nothing seemed to come of it. Due to sheer luck, a series of fortunate circumstances were to come: Urinetown was accepted into the New York International Fringe Festival and became the festival’s sold-out hit, famous playwright David Auburn saw the show at the festival and decided to fund productions, and in Spring 2001 the show opened off-Broadway.
                        <br><br>
                        The off-Broadway production drew demanding enough crowds to justify a move to Broadway that fall. Urinetown was slated to open on Broadway on September 13th, 2001. Two days before opening, though, the World Trade Center attacks occurred, putting all of New York City on pause. New York was not likely to embrace what Kotis calls “a doomsday musical”, but Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's insistence that New York shows go on, and his handout of tickets to public safety workers and people grounded after September 11, proved effective. "It was a wonderful thing to be a part of," says Kotis. "To feel like you were being rescued by your fellow citizens and also offering them a place to come together." Urinetown opened September 20, from there it has gone on to win several Tony awards and become a timeless piece of theatre.

                    <h3>Theatrical Influences</h3>
                    <p>
                        Greg Kotis and Mark Hollmann fully believed that no one would want to see Urinetown while they were creating it.
                        <br><br>
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>
                            "Mark and I come from a tradition in which you come up with a show and you do it. Doing it means getting your friends together and renting a space, usually a black box or a storefront. You send out press releases, you try to get listed, and you have a mailing party. Hopefully you don't lose too much money. And you hope you get a review and that someone says something nice about you, and you're one step closer to making a living in theater full time."

                    <p>
                        They would turn out to be wrong as Urinetown has become one of the most performed musicals of the 21st century. To fully understand why it became the hit it is today, its theatrical and musical influences must be examined.
                        <br><br>
                        Although the musical incorporates plot elements like good vs. evil and star-crossed lovers, Kotis and Hollmann keep the audience self aware by having characters consistently remind them that they are watching a performance. The aim of the self-referential style, Kotis says, is to break down the wall between audience and actors to convey that <i>we know that you know that we know that you know that this is a show.</i> Even the opening number reminds the audience that they are sitting in a theater with the lyric “Your ticket should say Urinetown!”. The self referential style combined with the cartoonish characters, comedic banter despite a grim backdrop, and the parodying of classic musical theatre elements put the audience into an absurd world that somehow mirrors ours.
                        <br><br>
                        <h4>Epic Theatre & Urinetown</h4>
                        Hollmann cites The Threepenny Opera by Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht as a major influence for the music of Urinetown. Brecht and Weill deliberately treated the moving parts of the show as opportunities to showcase juxtaposed styles of art, but more importantly, they emphasized the spectator’s awareness of the construction of the piece. As a result, the show aimed to expose the contradictions between the characters’ ideology of love and the economic circumstances that actually motivate their attempts to exploit one another for financial profit. Ultimately, The Threepenny Opera became the victim of its own success; bourgeois audiences could ignore its demand for social change by treating it as an joke at their own expense.
                        <br><br>
                        Brecht and Weill are now synonymous with the radical politics and cultural innovation of the Weimar Republic, and after its fall in Germany and the beginning of World War II, both eventually landed on the Nazi blacklist due to their productions. After The Threepenny Opera, Brecht began writing a series of short plays and essays that discussed his principles in making theatre social commentary. He is credited with creating the concept of <i>epic theatre</i>, which stands in direct opposition to dramatic theatre. Epic theatre is based on one of his principles, <i><i>Verfremdungseffekt</i></i>, which is also called the distancing effect. It is a technique of writing and performance that paints the existing social system with its injustice, inequality and corruption as a standard for the world the play is set in, but this standard is mean to shock the audience as a means of conveying that the standard is meant to be changed. By making spectators conscious of how the theatrical world they are watching has been created, a performance enables them to participate in a dialogue about how and why a change in society should be made. And this is where juxtaposing elements come into play; Brecht believed that putting clashing elements (an innocent young girl character singing a confrontational pirate’s song, etc.) together would achieve the effect he aimed for.
                        <br><br>
                        Brecht wanted theatre to feel like a boxing match, in that the audience knows that the two boxers are not fighting because they are angry at each other. Rather, the audience is aware that the construct is artificial. This is best illustrated in another of Brecht’s principles: <i>Gestus</i>. Brecht believed in not fully integrating the actor with the character they were playing. He described it as something similar to a bystander giving a witness statement of a car accident; the bystander is not the offender, nor the victim, but they are a storyteller. <i>Gestus</i>, or truly just a gesture, draws on this idea and gives the actor a physical action on stage that communicates social meaning. Instead of emphasising the emotional predisposition of characters, the <i>Gestus</i> allows the actor to demonstrate the social attitudes of one character in contrast with others, openly indicating the author’s view of the chain of events. <i>Gestus</i> is simply another way Brecht put the audience on the outside looking in to a fictitious society that reflected their own.
                        <br><br>
                        <h4>Parody of Musical Theatre Tropes</h4>
                        While both Brecht and Weill are influences today on political modes of theatre, Weill left his mark by composing many timeless songs like ‘Mack The Knife’ that captured emotions like despair or revolt while being set to catchy melodies. Mark Hollmann was inspired by Weill’s well-crafted scores and other classic American musicals like <i>Guys and Dolls</i>, <i>Hello, Dolly!,</i> and especially <i>West Side Story</i> and <i>Les Miserables</i>. The score of Urinetown lives up to the standard of these classics, with music that ties in gospel, jazz, Broadway, and opera. The truly American combination of stylistic musical influences complements the archetypes of songs found in the show that mirror those of <i>West Side Story</i> and <i>Les Miserables</i>. The parallels, like the calls to action by a young hero, cathartic cries for change, the vision of a better future, and eventual loss of hope, lull the audience into familiar musical territory that they will inevitably be shocked out of due to the fact that there is no redemption for our heroes in Urinetown. In doing so, Hollmann and Kotis reinforce that pluck, good intentions, and love can’t always put an end to deep rooted societal and economic issues. The music that carries the audience through the story is truly another Brechtian brush stroke on the face of Urinetown.

                    <h3>Encoded Ideologies</h3>
                    <p>
                        The encoded parody, satire and political commentary in Urinetown create a relationship with the audience that mimics an inside joke, in that most audience members have touched theatre or have life experiences that are being reflected (comedically and self-referentially) on stage. These experiences, art or life, directly connect to the politics of Urinetown, which is influenced heavily by several ideologies.
                        <br><br>
                        <h4>What is <i>Kafkaesque</i>?</h4>
                        The first is a literary theme that spans all of author Franz Kafka’s work. The term <i>Kafkaesque</i> has now lost some of its original meaning, but the true definition lies in Kafka’s stories, where his characters are faced with impossible situations where they must jump through endless bureaucratic hoops to solve them. Kafka drew from his experiences working as a clerk in the industrialist Austro-Hungarian Empire to create characters that are workers caught up in a system with absurd and confusing rules. What truly makes a situation or story kafkaesque is the individual’s circular logic in response to a system they are attempting to navigate, systems that are convoluted and only serve to perpetuate themselves. In Urinetown, this idea comes across in the bureaucracy of the UGC that puts inane restrictions on basic human needs.
                        <br><br>
                        <h4>A quick overview of Malthusian Theory</h4>
                        Kafka’s work reminds us that we live in a world that we create, which is exactly the spirit taken up by the rebels in Urinetown, but reforming administrative systems is tougher than what Hope Cladwell believes it to be. This is due to the imbalanced distribution of resources that is brought to the audience’s audition, perhaps most ardently, by the cry of “Hail Malthus!” at the end of the show. Thomas Robert Malthus, English scholar, wrote his original essay on “Principle of Population” in 1798 which stated, to summarize, that mankind’s consumption will perpetually exceed Earth’s production. Malthus’ essential argument is that since food is vital to the life of man, population increases when the food supply increases, but cannot rise permanently. Thus, preventative (human reasons why a person would choose not to have a large family) or positive (nature-induced population controls, like diseases, war, or famine) checks will be applied on the population.
                        <br><br>
                        Thomas Malthus turned out to be a bit off with his predictions. Populations in Europe did not increase as rapidly as he thought and production increased tremendous­ly because of the rapid advances in technology, resulting in a higher ceiling to the living standard. In his defense, his ideas were written with no inkling of what the future could hold. His theories about decreased crop turnout and positive checks in Britain could have been right if Britain didn’t become a world-engulfing empire. Regardless of the criticisms of his theories, Malthus was right to warn of what will come of increasing populations and diminishing resources, as many countries still face immense poverty and famine with exponentially increasing populations. Malthus’ true fear was a lack of appropriate resource management and consumption, hence the nod to his work in Urinetown.
                        <br><br>
                        <h4>The Brechtian Twist</h4>
                        With the twist at the end of Urinetown that tells the audience that revolution is not always the best call for change, contradicting the messages sent throughout the show, it’s hard to find what to take from the theater. Oddly enough, despite constantly being called Brechtian, Kotis and Hollman ultimately reject Brecht’s traditionally socialist critiques of the capitalist world. Brecht was a known Marxist whose work was aimed at waking up the working class to the possibility of a changed society where they no longer are disadvantaged. Urinetown seemingly follows this thread until the very end, where the audience is presented with the truth that the “good guy” is not always the best leader. This invalidates their experience, and undermines the perceived commentary on the corrupt nature of controlling bureaucracy throughout the show, reminding the audience that the romantic, bright-eyed hope of many past revolutionaries have ended in disaster.
                        <br><br>
                        Kotis and Hollman weave a complex web of emotions for their audiences that operates on many levels. As the audience is led to trust and root for the innocent heroes, they are eventually blindsided with truths about the difficulties of managing a society. However, the paramount level Urinetown operates on is the one connects back to why it was originally written: Urinetown’s writers believed no one would see it, so they allowed themselves to write a musical where good intentions fail in order to show that art cannot always make the effectual commentary an audience wants. The encoded ideologies that allow Urinetown to be so tied to 20th century history and the constructs of our societies only allow us to understand the gravity of a show that has built a world beyond morals and change.

                <div id="menu3" class="tab-pane fade">
                    <h3>Timelessness & Current Relevance</h3>
                    <p>
                        As it turns out, Bertolt Brecht had many female writers for his plays that he gave little to no credit to. The world in which Marx, Kafka, and Brecht worked in was a much more misogynistic, classist, and racist one than ours, not that it excuses any of their plausible discriminatory behavior. Examining how their work applies to Urinetown also means examining how their work applies to people outside of homogeneous European populations.
                        <br><br>
                        Urinetown highlights drastic problems in its world that mirrors ours extremely well: an ecological disaster, youth rising up to fight entrenched institutions, and the truth that nobody is innocent are all prominent ideas existing in our world. Like the poor in Urinetown, most people want freedom and equality for all people, and they want their politicians and those in power to do right by them. However, as the show highlights, doing what is “right” for people is a simple idea with many, many complications in its implementation.
                        <br><br>
                        Doing what is “right” can very quickly become an empty promise when the implementation aims to please everyone. This is how Urinetown continues to be applicable as decades pass: solutions that solve an entire population’s problems is not achievable. In a perfect world, Hope’s era of, well, hope would solve the town’s water problems. In a perfect world, Cladwell would be a just leader, and a revolution would never even need to have happened. There are no perfect worlds, there is just ours that for every fairly run company there is a mismanaged one, for every life-saving policy passed there is one that will cost lives, and for every neighborhood filled with green grass there is one in drought. Solid communication and unity would have likely prevented the spiraling revolution in Urinetown, but it is precisely the miscommunication and the fracturing of factions that cause it to mirror our world.
                        <br><br>
                        When we watch Urinetown’s moments of escalation and see the split-second decisions made due to desperation and anger, we see the side of humanity no one really puts on a stage. We can see how people fall in line into causes they only half understand, resulting in no one truly understanding each other. It’s laughable, how ugly we can be when we draw lines around who deserves to be preserved. This side of humanity is impulsive, emotional, illogical, and inherent. We aren’t human without it, and it might just be the real takeaway of the musical.
                        <br><br>
                        Innocence is an expense we cannot afford when we are human.
